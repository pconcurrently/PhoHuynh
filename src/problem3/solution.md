### Inefficiencies & Anti-patternsType Safety Issues

#### Type Safety Issues

- `blockchain` parameter in `getPriority` is typed as `any`
- Missing proper interface for the `blockchain` type
- Missing error handling for invalid `blockchain` values

#### Sorting Logic Issues

- The filter logic for `balances` is incorrect and has a reference error (lhsPriority is undefined)
- The sort comparison function doesn't handle equal priorities
- The sorting logic could be simplified

#### Performance Issues

- `useMemo` dependency array includes `prices` but it's not used in the calculation
- Unnecessary double iteration of `sortedBalances` with separate map operations
- Using array index as React key (anti-pattern)

#### Code Structure Issues

- `getPriority` function could be moved outside component or memoized
- blockchain priorities could be defined as a constant map
- Props interface is empty and could be more specific

#### Data Flow Issues

- No error handling for missing prices
- No loading states handled

#### Refactored Code
